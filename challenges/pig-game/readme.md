# Pig Game
"Pig Game" is a game where two players are competing to reach the score of 100 by rolling a dice

## What I learned ?
I compiled previously learned javascript fundamentals (objects,loops,conditions,function...) and my knowledge about Document Object Model (DOM) to create this small game where I had to handle different states for different players 

### Note : I don't claim to own the html/css part
